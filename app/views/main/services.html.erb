      <p>
        We offer an evidence-based curriculum designed to teach children the language 
        and skills to stay safe. 
        <a href="http://kidshavehope.org/about_us">Trained professionals</a> will use the 
        curriculum in the student's classroom as a tool to teach appropriate boundaries, 
        body safety rules, internet safety, how to protect yourself and others against 
        bullying, and empowerment to prevent and stop abuse.
